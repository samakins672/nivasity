# OTP Resend Investigation Report

**Date:** 2026-02-16  
**Investigation Status:** Complete  
**Requested by:** Repository Owner

## Executive Summary

This investigation examined the OTP (One-Time Password) resend functionality for unverified users in the Nivasity platform. **We confirmed that multiple OTP resend mechanisms exist**, including both user-initiated and admin-initiated flows.

---

## Key Findings

### 1. **User-Initiated OTP Resend** ✅
**File:** `/API/auth/resend-otp.php`

**Purpose:** Allows unverified users to request a new verification OTP via API endpoint.

**How it works:**
- Accepts POST requests with user's email
- Validates that the user exists and has `status = 'unverified'`
- Prevents already verified users from resending OTP
- Generates a new 6-digit OTP with 10-minute expiration
- Sends OTP via email using Brevo mail service
- Returns success/error response

**Security Features:**
- Validates user exists before sending
- Checks user status (must be 'unverified')
- Prevents resending to verified accounts
- Deletes any existing OTPs before creating new one
- Sets expiration time (10 minutes)

**API Endpoint:** `/API/auth/resend-otp.php`

**Request Format:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com"
}
```

---

### 2. **User-Initiated Link Resend** ✅
**File:** `/API/auth/resend-verification.php`

**Purpose:** Allows unverified users to request a new verification link (not OTP) via API endpoint.

**How it works:**
- Accepts POST requests with user's email
- Validates that the user exists and has `status = 'unverified'`
- Prevents already verified users from resending
- Generates 12-character verification code (same as admin system)
- Sends verification link based on role (not OTP code)
- **No expiration set** (same concern as admin system)

**Security Features:**
- Validates user exists before sending
- Checks user status (must be 'unverified')
- Prevents resending to verified accounts
- Updates existing code or creates new one
- Uses unique code generation

**API Endpoint:** `/API/auth/resend-verification.php`

**Request Format:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com"
}
```

---

### 3. **Admin Bulk Resend** ✅
**File:** `/admin/resend_pending_verifications.php`

**Purpose:** Allows authorized administrators to bulk resend verification emails to ALL unverified users.

**How it works:**
- Restricted to 3 specific email addresses (hardcoded authorization):
  - `akinyemisamuel170@gmail.com`
  - `samuel@nivasity.com`
  - `blessing.cf@nivasity.com`
- Queries database for all users with `status = 'unverified'`
- Generates 12-character verification codes (NOT OTP format)
- Sends verification links (not OTP codes) based on user role:
  - `org_admin` → `setup_org.html?verify={code}`
  - `visitor` → `verify.html?verify={code}`
  - Default → `setup.html?verify={code}`
- Displays HTML summary page with results

**Security Features:**
- Access restricted to 3 authorized admin emails
- Requires active session (`$_SESSION['nivas_userId']`)
- Uses verification links instead of OTP codes
- Sets no expiration (`exp_date = NULL`)

**Access:** Direct URL access by authorized admins only (not linked in UI navigation)

---

### 4. **Initial Registration Flow** ✅
**File:** `/API/auth/register.php`

- Creates user with `status = 'unverified'`
- Automatically generates and sends 6-digit OTP (10-minute expiration)
- Uses same OTP format as resend endpoint

---

### 5. **OTP Verification** ✅
**File:** `/API/auth/verify-otp.php`

- Validates OTP against user_id and expiration
- Updates user status from 'unverified' to 'verified'
- Generates JWT tokens upon successful verification
- Deletes used OTP from database

## Comparison: Three Different Verification/Resend Systems

| Feature | API OTP System | API Link System | Admin Bulk Link System |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **File** | `resend-otp.php` | `resend-verification.php` | `resend_pending_verifications.php` |
| **Code Format** | 6-digit numeric | 12-char alphanumeric | 12-char alphanumeric |
| **Delivery** | Email with OTP | Email with link | Email with link |
| **Expiration** | 10 minutes | None (NULL) | None (NULL) |
| **Verification** | Manual OTP entry | Click link | Click link |
| **Who Triggers** | User themselves | User themselves | Authorized admins |
| **Target** | Individual user | Individual user | All unverified (bulk) |
| **Use Case** | Modern API flow | Legacy API flow | Admin bulk operations |

## Security Considerations

### ✅ **Good Security Practices:**
1. OTPs have reasonable expiration time (10 minutes)
2. Users must be 'unverified' to receive new OTP
3. Verified accounts cannot request resend (prevents abuse)
4. Old OTPs are deleted before generating new ones
5. Admin bulk resend is restricted to specific emails
6. Session validation required for admin access

### ⚠️ **Potential Concerns:**
1. **Link-based verification codes have NO expiration** - codes generated by `resend-verification.php` and admin bulk resend never expire (`exp_date = NULL`)
2. **Hardcoded admin emails** - authorization list is hardcoded in PHP file
3. **No rate limiting visible** - no apparent throttling on OTP/link resend requests
4. **Three parallel verification systems** - OTP-based and two link-based systems coexist, which may cause confusion
5. **Inconsistent security** - OTP system has expiration but link systems don't

---

## Database Schema (Inferred)

**`users` table:**
- `id` - user identifier
- `email` - user email address
- `status` - user status ('unverified', 'verified', etc.)
- `first_name`, `last_name` - user names
- `role` - user role ('student', 'org_admin', 'visitor', etc.)

**`verification_code` table:**
- `user_id` - foreign key to users.id
- `code` - verification code (6-digit OTP or 12-char string)
- `exp_date` - expiration timestamp (NULLABLE)

---

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Security Improvements
1. **Add expiration to admin-generated codes:** Set reasonable expiration (e.g., 24-48 hours) instead of NULL
2. **Implement rate limiting:** Prevent OTP spam by limiting resend frequency (e.g., max 3 requests per hour)
3. **Move admin emails to config:** Store authorized admin emails in database or config file, not hardcoded

### Priority 2: User Experience
4. **Consolidate verification systems:** Three different systems exist - consider standardizing on one approach (recommend OTP with expiration)
5. **Add UI link for resend:** Make resend functionality more discoverable in the UI
6. **Improve error messages:** Provide clearer feedback about why resend might fail
7. **Deprecate link-based systems:** Phase out `resend-verification.php` in favor of secure OTP system

### Priority 3: Monitoring & Logging
7. **Log resend attempts:** Track OTP resend requests for security monitoring
8. **Alert on bulk operations:** Notify when admin bulk resend is used
9. **Monitor verification completion rates:** Track how many users successfully verify

---

## Conclusion

**Yes, there are files/code that resend OTP/verification to unverified users.** Specifically:

1. **`/API/auth/resend-otp.php`** - User-initiated OTP resend (modern, secure with expiration)
2. **`/API/auth/resend-verification.php`** - User-initiated link resend (legacy, no expiration)
3. **`/admin/resend_pending_verifications.php`** - Admin bulk link resend (legacy, no expiration)

All three mechanisms are working as intended but have significant differences in security:
- **OTP system** has 10-minute expiration ✅
- **Link systems** have NO expiration ⚠️
- Only OTP system follows security best practices

**Critical findings:**
- Three parallel verification systems exist (should consolidate)
- Link-based systems lack expiration (security concern)
- No rate limiting on any resend endpoints
- Hardcoded admin authorization

The system is functional but needs consolidation and security improvements, particularly adding expiration to all verification codes and implementing rate limiting.
