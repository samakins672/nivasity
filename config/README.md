# Mail configuration

Create a `config/mail.php` file in this directory (it remains ignored by git) and define your SMTP and Brevo credentials as PHP `define` statements. You can copy from `mail.example.php` and update the placeholders. The application automatically loads `config/mail.php` wherever mail functions are used.
